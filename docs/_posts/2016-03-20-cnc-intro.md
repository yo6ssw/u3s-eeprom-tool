## What is a CNC machine?

_CNC_ stands for **Computer Numerical Control**. A _CNC machine_ is a machine tool controlled by a computer. The type of machines that can be controlled can be either a  mill, router, grinder or lathe.

The CNC machine is controlled through a language called [G-Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code). The most common CNC machines have 3 axis, which means they can move the head relative to the working material on any 

## Usage

I intend to use my incoming CNC machine for the following:

- pcb milling
- drilling
- front panel cutting
- sticker cutting

## Toolchain

- KiCad will be used for schematic capture and PCB design. It will also be used to export gerber files out of the resulting PCB.
- pcb2gcode will be used to convert the 

## Exporting from Eagle

- use cam processor and load our cam job
- make sure drilling section has "Excellon_24" selected as format
- post process the .TXT excelleon file and replace M72 with "INCH.TZ"

## Steps


- perform autoleveling
- top etching
- top drilling
- top alignment drilling
- top edge cutting (milling)
- flip the board on the y axis and put some pins into the alignment drilled holes. This will ensure

Last Friday I attended a Siemens event in Brasov, called Curious Minds. There I had the fortunate chance of meeting some of the programming gods.

The event was focused on introducing the **D** language to the masses and the main speakers were [Andrei Alexandrescu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Alexandrescu) and [Walter Bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bright) with a guest appearance from [Scott Meyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Meyers). 

Who might those gods be, you ask?

**Walter** is the creator of the D language and to be honest I didn't hear about him until this event. But by simply observing his talk you could plainly see how awesomely knowledgeable he is in compiler technologies and low level stuff. His talk was about _Interfacing D to legacy C++ code_ and he did a wonderful job presenting the hurdles that D overcome in doing so. Did I mention he also wrote a fully compliant C++ compiler back in the days? A true humble and elite old-school geek!

**Andrei** is something more of a curious case. He used to write for C++ columns and wrote some books on C++ like _Modern C++ Design_ and _C++ Coding Standards_ (co-author) yet after a while he gave up C++ and switched to D. He was an important contributor to the language and has since become a co-founder. He used to work at Facebook as a research scientist but quit that too and focused his entire resources on D. 

_A few cool things about D_ was the title of the keynote in which he presented some interesting features of the language constantly comparing them with other languages, both interpreted as well as compiled. This one really nailed it for me and made me curious in finding out more about D.

The title of the second talk he held, _Writing quick code, quickly_ led me to believe it's about how D can help you write code quickly, but boy was I wrong; it was all about low level stuff and performance optimisation, guidelines that every programmer should know, regardless of the language.

Andrei's talks were full of energy revealing his intrinsic nature. That guy is one cool guy!

**Scott** is an author and consultant on C++ software development. If you happened to read any of his _Effective_ series books (Effective C++, More Effective C++, Effective STL) then you definitely know his unforgettable style. This guy is a brilliant speaker, a very humble person and a fountain of wisdom. I totally loved his style!

As it usually happens, it was impossible to stick to the schedule so at the end they had to drop some talk and replace it with a book-winning-contest in which one would have to ask the panel questions that would yield the most embarassing answer in order to win a book from the authors. There were 8 books per total and 400 people so the chances were slim. Walter had two _Programming in D_ copies, Andrei had one each _The D Programming Language_, _Modern C++ Design_ and Scott had three _Effective Modern C++_ copies. Needless to say I wanted them all :)

I launched my questions to the panel and both Scott and Andrei came forward with a book in their hand. Alas I could only take one book so I received the _Effective Modern C++_ that Scott so gracefully offered. Snap! I would have wanted the D book too, so bad, since who knows whenever I'll get the chance of meeting the guys again in order to ask for an autograph.

All in all it was a wonderful evening. When the event finished I went to Scott to sign the book and asked him if he minds if Andrei and Walter sign on it. Turns out he didn't, so now I have an _Effective Modern C++_ copy signed by the three gods. Yey! While I asked Andrei to sign it, he told me that I had the best questions and answers in the whole conference (the performance talk comes to mind, when after answering a mantissa related question, Andrei said "me and this guy are going to have a beer after this talk"). Needless to say that the impostor syndrome was gone for the rest of the night.

As an aftermath, I started learning D and I'm constantly amazed by the beauty and convenience of the language. Thanks, guys!
