title: What would you do
---
Here's one question (a likely result of too much beer): suppose you survive the end of the world and you happen to run into a group of people (survivors) in the middle of a post-apocalyptic world. You naturally express your great desire to join the group (the more the merrier), but when you do you are faced with the following question: what skills do you think you possess that would benefit the group enough to make wasting existing resources on your sorry ass not a bad business? Remember, computers do not exist anymore due to EMP shockwaves so being a programming guru is worthless now.

Let me know.
